Notes v2.0beta4 [2005-02-25] (kumar.mcmillan/gmail.com):
------
- Added PHP Documentor snippets (snippet "phpdoc_u" prints usage)

------
- Added PHP5 language constructs and PHPDoc tags to inline comments

Notes v2.0beta2 [2005-02-23]:

- Under Allan suggestion I stripped out some functions from the list.
  Stripped functions:
    * Advanced PHP debugger functions
    * Aspell functions
    * PHP bytecode Compiler
    * CCVS API Functions
    * COM and .Net (any complains about this?) 
    * Cybercash Payment Functions (is someone really using them?)
    * DBM Functions
    * DOM Functions (most of them are class functions, don't know how to
      handle them exactly with code highlighting)
    * DOM XML Functions (same as above)
    * Hyperwave Functions
    * Hyperwave API Functions
    * ICAP Functions
    * Ingres II Functions (removed as considered experimental)
    * mailparse Functions
    * MCVE Payment Functions
    * Memcache Functions
    * mnoGoSearch Functions           
    * Mohawk Software Session Handler Functions (I heard bugs about it)
    * muscat Functions (here kitty-kitty-kitty!)
    * Ncurses Terminal Screen Control Functions
    * YP/NIS Functions
    * OpenAL Audio Bindings
    * PDO Functions
    * Verisign Payflow Pro Functions
    * XSL functions
    * YAZ Functions
	
  Please let me know if you think I removed an important set of functions
  or you think I kept useless ones.
	
- I heard a new code colouring method is under development, so I am not
  working anymore on color scheme until the new TM version will be available
  

Notes v2.0beta1 [2005-02-21] (Matteo Spinelli):
------
- added all 3500+ PHP's functions, deprecated onces are also available but
  commented out
- all functions are grouped by topic/type and displayed alphabetically
- new color scheme 

Notes v1.0 [Original version by: Justin French, Sune Foldager, Allan Odgaard]
------
- commented out the auto-indent feature, because it helps some, and makes
  life a real pain for others, depending on coding style
- PHP's 3500+ native functions aren't here yet -- just reserved words and
  basic constants from the docs, plus the control structures and language
  constructs
